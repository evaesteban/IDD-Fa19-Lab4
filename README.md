# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Eva Pilar Esteban Velasco*


## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your vibration motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Brown = Ground, Red = Power, Orange = Signal.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Pin 9.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

Inside the loop(), the two for() loops control the angle, going from 0 to 180 degrees, and they control the speed by setting a delay of 15 ms between each movement.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
